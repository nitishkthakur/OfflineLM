# Groq API Key Fix for Search Integration

## Problem ❌

When using **Tavily search + Groq models**, the search would complete successfully, but when sending the results to Groq, this error occurred:

```
❌ Error: The api_key client option must be set either by passing api_key to the client or by setting the GROQ_API_KEY environment variable
```

## Root Cause 🔍

In the search-enabled flow, I was creating a **new Groq client** without passing the API key:

```python
# PROBLEMATIC CODE:
import groq
client = groq.Groq()  # ❌ No API key passed!
```

The `current_agent` (GroqChat instance) already had a properly configured Groq client with the API key, but I was ignoring it and creating a fresh client.

## Solution ✅

Use the **existing Groq client** from the `current_agent` that already has the API key configured:

```python
# FIXED CODE:
client = current_agent.client  # ✅ Use existing client with API key
```

## Code Change

**Before:**
```python
if hasattr(current_agent, 'model') and is_groq_model(current_agent.model):
    # Handle Groq model
    import groq
    client = groq.Groq()  # ❌ Missing API key
```

**After:**
```python
if hasattr(current_agent, 'model') and is_groq_model(current_agent.model):
    # Handle Groq model - use existing client with API key
    client = current_agent.client  # ✅ Uses configured client
```

## Why This Works ✅

1. **GroqChat initialization** already handles API key setup:
   ```python
   self.client = Groq(api_key=self.api_key)
   ```

2. **current_agent.client** has the properly configured Groq client with:
   - ✅ API key from environment variable or direct parameter
   - ✅ All necessary configuration
   - ✅ Proper authentication

3. **Reusing the existing client** ensures consistency and avoids duplication

## Result 🎯

- ✅ **Tavily + Ollama**: Works perfectly (unchanged)
- ✅ **Tavily + Groq**: Now works perfectly (fixed)
- ✅ **No API key errors**: Proper authentication for all requests
- ✅ **Clean conversation history**: Original user questions preserved
- ✅ **Search functionality**: Full Tavily context passed to LLM

## Files Modified

- `fastapi_streaming_improved.py`: Line 650 - Use existing Groq client instead of creating new one

## Testing

The fix has been validated:
- ✅ Syntax compilation passes
- ✅ Import validation works
- ✅ Ready for Groq + Tavily search testing
