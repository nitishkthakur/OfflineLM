There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-28) Congress finished work on the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\") to establish a [perpetual union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Union \"Perpetual Union\") between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for [ratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification \"Ratification\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26)\n",

It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Kelly-27) This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of [Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown \"The Crown\") and [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\") ought to have functioned with respect to the royal [dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\"): a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Kelly-27) The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly [royal prerogatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative \"Royal prerogative\") (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments.

While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a [two-thirds vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote \"Supermajority\") of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill.

The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit.

       "Two doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy.

When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\"), the Supreme Court ruled in _[United States v. Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\_States\\_v.\\_Nixon \"United States v.

When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [Lewinsky scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal \"Clinton–Lewinsky scandal\"), the Supreme Court ruled in _[Clinton v. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton\\_v.\\_Jones \"Clinton v. Jones\")_, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [legal precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent \"Precedent\") that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-107)\n",

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions.\n",

Use of the state secrets privilege in courts has grown significantly over the last twenty-five years. In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown.

       "##### **Donald J. Trump is the 45th President of the United States. He believes the United States has incredible potential and will go on to exceed even its remarkable achievements of the past.**\n",
       "\n",
       "Donald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. Mr. Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.\n",
       "\n",
       "A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book,_The Art of the Deal_, is considered a business classic.\n",
       "\n",
       "Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16, 2015. He then accepted the Republican nomination for President of the United States in July of 2016, having defeated 17 other contenders during the Republican primaries.\n",
       "\n",
       "On November 8, 2016, Mr. Trump was elected President in the largest Electoral College landslide for a Republican in 28 years. Mr. Trump won more than 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. He received the votes of more than 62 million Americans, the most ever for a Republican candidate.\n",
       "\n",
       "President Trump has delivered historic results in his first term in office despite partisan gridlock in the Nation’s Capital, and resistance from special interests and the Washington Establishment.\n",
       "\n",
       "He passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 2 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation’s borders.\n",
       "\n",
       "To vanquish the COVID-19 global pandemic, President Trump launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II. The Trump Administration enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history, created the most advanced testing system in the world, developed effective medical treatments to save millions of lives, and launched Operation Warp Speed to deliver a vaccine in record time and defeat the Virus.\n",
       "\n",
       "President Trump and his wife, Melania, are parents to their son, Barron. Mr. Trump also has four adult children, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 10 grandchildren.\n",

       "\n",
       "After a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people.\n",
       "\n",
       "This includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nation’s borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream.\n",
       "\n",
       "In his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation’s borders in his first four years in office. This was only the beginning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Donald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service.\n",
       "\n",
       "He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office. He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him. Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world.\n",
       "\n",
       "President Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book, The Art of the Deal, is considered a business classic.\n",
       "\n",
       "President Trump has five children, Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 11 grandchildren.\n",

       "In his first administration, as America’s 45th president, Trump achieved U.S. energy independence, launched the Space Force, achieved a major breakthrough for Middle East peace and secured U.S. borders.\n",

       "Trump won the presidency following his first campaign for any public office, and his public service builds on his successes in private life. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into real estate development, making his mark in New York City. He believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see the United States succeed.\n",
       "\n",
       "An accomplished author, Trump has written numerous bestsellers. His first book,_The Art of the Deal_, is considered a business classic. He has five children: Barron, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric and Tiffany, as well as 10 grandchildren.\n",

For much of the 20th century, especially during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War \"Cold War\"), the U.S. president was often called \"the leader of the free world\".[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-freeworld-20)\\n\\n[Article II of the Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") establishes the executive branch of the federal government and vests executive power in the president. The power includes the execution and enforcement of federal law and the responsibility to appoint federal executive, diplomatic, regulatory, and judicial officers. Based on constitutional provisions empowering the president to appoint and receive ambassadors and conclude treaties with foreign powers, and on subsequent laws enacted by Congress, the modern presidency has primary responsibility for conducting U.S. foreign policy. The role includes responsibility for directing the world\\'s [most expensive military](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures \"List of countries by military expenditures\"), which has the [second-largest nuclear arsenal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons \"List of states with nuclear weapons\").\\n\\nThe president also plays a leading role in federal legislation and domestic policymaking. As part of the system of [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution \"Separation of powers under the United States Constitution\"), [Article I, Section 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_7:_Bills \"Article One of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution gives the president the power to sign or [veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto_power_in_the_United_States \"Veto power in the United States\") federal legislation. Since modern presidents are typically viewed as leaders of their political parties, major policymaking is significantly shaped by the outcome of presidential elections, with presidents taking an active role in promoting their policy priorities to members of Congress who are often electorally dependent on the president.[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-21) In recent decades, presidents have also made increasing use of [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order \"Executive order\"), agency regulations, and judicial appointments to shape domestic policy.\\n\\nThe president is [elected indirectly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_election \"Indirect election\") through the [Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College \"United States Electoral College\") to a four-year term, along with the [vice president](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States \"Vice President of the United States\"). Under the [Twenty-second Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment \"Twenty-second Amendment\"), ratified in 1951, no person who has been elected to two presidential terms may be elected to a third. In addition, nine vice presidents have become president by virtue of a [president\\'s intra-term death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States_who_died_in_office \"List of presidents of the United States who died in office\") or [resignation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_resignation \"Nixon resignation\").[[C]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-22) In all, [45 individuals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_presidents_of_the_United_States \"List of presidents of the United States\") have served 47 presidencies spanning 60 four-year terms.[[D]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-24)[Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") is the 47th and current president since January 20, 2025.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-25)\\n\\nHistory and development\\n-----------------------\\n\\n### Origins\\n\\nIn July 1776, the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies \"Thirteen Colonies\"), represented at the [Second Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress \"Second Continental Congress\") in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"), unanimously adopted the [United States Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States Declaration of Independence\") in which the colonies declared themselves to be independent [sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_state \"Sovereign state\") and no longer under [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\") rule.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26) The affirmation was made in the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence \"United States Declaration of Independence\"), which was written predominantly by [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") and adopted unanimously on July 4, 1776, by the Second Continental Congress. Recognizing the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the [British](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\"),[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Kelly-27) the Continental Congress simultaneously began the process of drafting a constitution that would bind the [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state \"U.S. state\") together. There were long debates on a number of issues, including representation and voting, and the exact powers to be given the central government.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-28) Congress finished work on the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation \"Articles of Confederation\") to establish a [perpetual union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perpetual_Union \"Perpetual Union\") between the states in November 1777 and sent it to the states for [ratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratification \"Ratification\").[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26)\\n\\nUnder the Articles, which [took effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_into_force \"Coming into force\") on March 1, 1781, the [Congress of the Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_the_Confederation \"Congress of the Confederation\") was a central political authority without any legislative power. It could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, and could not impose any taxes or enforce local commercial regulations upon its citizens.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Kelly-27) This institutional design reflected how Americans believed the deposed British system of [Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown \"The Crown\") and [Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Great_Britain \"Parliament of Great Britain\") ought to have functioned with respect to the royal [dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion \"Dominion\"): a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Kelly-27) The states were out from under any monarchy and assigned some formerly [royal prerogatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_prerogative \"Royal prerogative\") (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress; the remaining prerogatives were lodged within their own respective state governments. The members of Congress elected a [president of the United States in Congress Assembled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Continental_Congress \"President of the Continental Congress\") to preside over its deliberation as a neutral [discussion moderator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discussion_moderator \"Discussion moderator\"). Unrelated to and quite dissimilar from the later office of president of the United States, it was a largely ceremonial position with no executive powers other than presiding over a parliamentary body.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-29)\\n\\nIn 1783, the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) \"Treaty of Paris (1783)\") secured independence for each of the former colonies. With peace at hand, the states each turned toward their own internal affairs.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26) By 1786, Americans found their continental borders besieged and weak and their respective economies in crises as neighboring states agitated trade rivalries with one another. They witnessed their [hard currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_currency \"Hard currency\") pouring into foreign markets to pay for imports, their [Mediterranean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Sea \"Mediterranean Sea\") commerce preyed upon by [North African](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa \"North Africa\")[pirates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbary_pirates \"Barbary pirates\"), and their foreign-financed Revolutionary War debts unpaid and accruing interest.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26) Civil and political unrest loomed. Events such as the [Newburgh Conspiracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newburgh_Conspiracy \"Newburgh Conspiracy\") and [Shays\\' Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shays%27_Rebellion \"Shays\\' Rebellion\") demonstrated that the Articles of Confederation were not working, in particular that a stronger national government with an empowered executive was necessary.\\n\\nFollowing the successful resolution of commercial and fishing disputes between [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia \"Virginia\") and Maryland at the [Mount Vernon Conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Vernon_Conference \"Mount Vernon Conference\") in 1785, Virginia called for a trade conference between all the states, set for September 1786 in [Annapolis, Maryland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis,_Maryland \"Annapolis, Maryland\"), with an aim toward resolving further-reaching interstate commercial antagonisms. When the [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annapolis_Convention_(1786) \"Annapolis Convention (1786)\") failed for lack of attendance due to suspicions among most of the other states, [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") of New York led the Annapolis delegates in a call for a convention to offer revisions to the Articles, to be held the next spring in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia \"Philadelphia\"). Prospects for the next convention appeared bleak until [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") and [Edmund Randolph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmund_Randolph \"Edmund Randolph\") succeeded in securing [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\")\\'s attendance to Philadelphia as a delegate for Virginia.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Beeman-30)\\n\\nWhen the [Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States) \"Constitutional Convention (United States)\") convened in May 1787, the 12 state delegations in attendance ([Rhode Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhode_Island \"Rhode Island\") did not send delegates) brought with them an accumulated experience over a diverse set of institutional arrangements between legislative and executive branches from within their respective state governments. Most states maintained a weak executive without veto or appointment powers, elected annually by the legislature to a single term only, sharing power with an executive council, and countered by a strong legislature.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26)[New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state) \"New York (state)\") offered the greatest exception, having a strong, unitary governor with veto and appointment power elected to a three-year term, and eligible for reelection to an indefinite number of terms thereafter.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-Milkis-26) It was through the closed-door negotiations at Philadelphia that the presidency framed in the [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States \"Constitution of the United States\") emerged.\\n\\n### 1789–1933\\n\\n[![Image 14](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg/250px-Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gilbert_Stuart_Williamstown_Portrait_of_George_Washington.jpg)\\n\\n[George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\"), the first president of the United States\\n\\nAs the nation\\'s first president, [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington \"George Washington\") established many norms that would come to define the office.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-31)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-32) His decision to retire after two terms helped address fears that the nation would devolve into monarchy and established a precedent that would not be broken until 1940 and would eventually be made permanent by the [Twenty-Second Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-Second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-Second Amendment to the United States Constitution\"). By the end of his presidency, political parties had developed,[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-33) with [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") defeating [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") in 1796, the first truly contested presidential election.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-34) After Jefferson defeated Adams in 1800, he and his fellow Virginians [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") and [James Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe \"James Monroe\") would each serve two terms, eventually dominating the nation\\'s politics during the [Era of Good Feelings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era_of_Good_Feelings \"Era of Good Feelings\") until Adams\\' son [John Quincy Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Quincy_Adams \"John Quincy Adams\") won election in 1824 after the [Democratic-Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\") split.\\n\\nThe election of [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson \"Andrew Jackson\") in 1828 was a significant milestone, as Jackson was not part of the Virginia and Massachusetts elite that had held the presidency for its first 40 years.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-35)[Jacksonian democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonian_democracy \"Jacksonian democracy\") sought to strengthen the presidency at the expense of Congress, while broadening public participation as the nation rapidly expanded westward.

Nevertheless, the modern presidency exerts significant power over legislation, both due to constitutional provisions and historical developments over time.\\n\\n### Signing and vetoing bills\\n\\n[![Image 16](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a9/Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Civil_Rights_Act%2C_July_2%2C_1964.jpg/250px-Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Civil_Rights_Act%2C_July_2%2C_1964.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lyndon_Johnson_signing_Civil_Rights_Act,_July_2,_1964.jpg)\\n\\nPresident [Lyndon B. Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson \"Lyndon B. Johnson\") signs the [1964 Civil Rights Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act_of_1964 \"Civil Rights Act of 1964\") at the [White House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House \"White House\") on July 2, 1964, as [Martin Luther King Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr. \"Martin Luther King Jr.\") and others look on.\\n\\nThe president\\'s most significant legislative power derives from the [Presentment Clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentment_Clause \"Presentment Clause\"), which gives the president the power to veto any [bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law) \"Bill (law)\") passed by [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\"). While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a [two-thirds vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote \"Supermajority\") of both houses, which is usually very difficult to achieve except for widely supported bipartisan legislation. The framers of the Constitution feared that Congress would seek to increase its power and enable a \"tyranny of the majority\", so giving the indirectly elected president a veto was viewed as an important check on the legislative power. While George Washington believed the veto should only be used in cases where a bill was unconstitutional, it is now routinely used in cases where presidents have policy disagreements with a bill. The veto – or threat of a veto – has thus evolved to make the modern presidency a central part of the American legislative process.\\n\\nSpecifically, under the Presentment Clause, once a bill has been presented by Congress, the president has three options:\\n\\n1.   Sign the legislation within ten days, excluding Sundays, the bill [becomes law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coming_into_force \"Coming into force\").\\n2.   [Veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto_power_in_the_United_States \"Veto power in the United States\") the legislation within the above timeframe and return it to the house of Congress from which it originated, expressing any objections, the bill does not become law, unless both houses of Congress vote to override the veto by a [two-thirds vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Two-thirds_vote \"Supermajority\").\\n3.   Take no action on the legislation within the above timeframe—the bill becomes law, as if the president had signed it, unless Congress is adjourned at the time, in which case it does not become law, which is known as a [pocket veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_veto \"Pocket veto\").\\n\\nIn 1996, Congress attempted to enhance the president\\'s veto power with the [Line Item Veto Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_Item_Veto_Act_of_1996 \"Line Item Veto Act of 1996\"). The legislation empowered the president to sign any spending bill into law while simultaneously striking certain spending items within the bill, particularly any new spending, any amount of discretionary spending, or any new limited tax benefit. Congress could then repass that particular item. If the president then vetoed the new legislation, Congress could override the veto by its ordinary means, a two-thirds vote in both houses. In _[Clinton v. City of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton\\\\_v.\\\\_City\\\\_of\\\\_New\\\\_York \"Clinton v. City of New York\")_, [524](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Supreme_Court_cases,_volume_524 \"List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 524\")[U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Reports \"United States Reports\")[417](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/524/417/) (1998), the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United States\") ruled such a legislative alteration of the veto power to be unconstitutional.\\n\\n### Setting the agenda\\n\\n[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Donald_Trump_State_of_the_Union_2018_%2826133528958%29.jpg/250px-Donald_Trump_State_of_the_Union_2018_%2826133528958%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Donald_Trump_State_of_the_Union_2018_(26133528958).jpg)\\n\\nPresident [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") delivers his [2018 State of the Union Address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_State_of_the_Union_Address \"2018 State of the Union Address\") before [Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress \"United States Congress\")\\n\\nFor most of American history, candidates for president have sought election on the basis of a promised legislative agenda. [Article II, Section 3, Clause 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Section_3:_Presidential_responsibilities \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") requires the president to recommend such measures to Congress which the president deems \"necessary and expedient\". This is done through the constitutionally-based [State of the Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_the_Union \"State of the Union\") address, which usually outlines the president\\'s legislative proposals for the coming year, and through other formal and informal communications with Congress.\\n\\nThe president can be involved in crafting legislation by suggesting, requesting, or even insisting that Congress enact laws that the president believes are needed. Additionally, the president can attempt to shape legislation during the legislative process by exerting influence on individual members of Congress.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-74) Presidents possess this power because the Constitution is silent about who can write legislation, but the power is limited because only members of Congress can introduce legislation.[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-75)\\n\\nThe president or other officials of the executive branch may draft legislation and then ask senators or representatives to introduce these drafts into Congress. Additionally, the president may attempt to have Congress alter proposed legislation by threatening to veto that legislation unless requested changes are made.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-76)\\n\\n### Promulgating regulations\\n\\nMany laws enacted by Congress do not address every possible detail, and either explicitly or implicitly delegate powers of implementation to an appropriate federal agency. As the head of the executive branch, presidents control a vast array of [agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States \"List of federal agencies in the United States\") that can issue regulations with little oversight from Congress.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, critics charged that too many legislative and budgetary powers that should have belonged to Congress had slid into the hands of presidents. One critic charged that presidents could appoint a \"virtual army of \\'czars\\'—each wholly unaccountable to Congress yet tasked with spearheading major policy efforts for the White House\".[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws28sep08-77) Presidents have been criticized for making [signing statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signing_statement \"Signing statement\") when signing congressional legislation about how they understand a bill or plan to execute it.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-twsSEPrt8jyh5-72) This practice has been criticized by the [American Bar Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Bar_Association \"American Bar Association\") as unconstitutional.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws11nov301-78) Conservative commentator [George Will](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Will \"George Will\") wrote of an \"increasingly swollen executive branch\" and \"the eclipse of Congress\".[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws28sep-79)\\n\\n### Convening and adjourning Congress\\n\\nTo allow the government to act quickly in case of a major domestic or international crisis arising when Congress is not in session, the president is empowered by [Article II, Section 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_3:_Extraordinary_sessions_and_prorogation_of_Congress \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution to call a [special session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_session \"Special session\") of one or both houses of Congress. Since [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams \"John Adams\") first did so in 1797, the president has called the full Congress to convene for a special session on 27 occasions. [Harry S. Truman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_S._Truman \"Harry S. Truman\") was the most recent to do so in July 1948, known as the [Turnip Day Session](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turnip_Day_Session \"Turnip Day Session\"). In addition, prior to ratification of the [Twentieth Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution\") in 1933, which brought forward the date on which Congress convenes from December to January, newly [inaugurated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration \"United States presidential inauguration\") presidents would routinely call the Senate to meet to confirm nominations or ratify treaties. In practice, the power has fallen into disuse in the modern era as Congress now formally remains in session year-round, convening pro forma sessions every three days even when ostensibly in recess. Correspondingly, the president is authorized to adjourn Congress if the House and Senate cannot agree on the time of adjournment; no president has ever had to exercise this power.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-80)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-81)\\n\\nExecutive powers\\n----------------\\n\\nMain article: [Powers of the president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Powers_of_the_president_of_the_United_States \"Powers of the president of the United States\")\\n\\n> Suffice it to say that the President is made the sole repository of the executive powers of the United States, and the powers entrusted to him as well as the duties imposed upon him are awesome indeed.\\n\\n_[Nixon v.

Generally, a president may remove executive officials at will.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-86) However, Congress can curtail and constrain a president\\'s authority to fire commissioners of independent regulatory agencies and certain inferior executive officers by [statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute \"Statute\").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-87)\\n\\nTo manage the growing federal bureaucracy, presidents have gradually surrounded themselves with many layers of staff, who were eventually organized into the [Executive Office of the President of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States \"Executive Office of the President of the United States\"). Within the Executive Office, the president\\'s innermost layer of aides, and their assistants, are located in the [White House Office](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House_Office \"White House Office\").\\n\\nThe president also possesses the power to manage operations of the federal government by issuing various [types of directives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_directive \"Presidential directive\"), such as [presidential proclamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_proclamation_(United_States) \"Presidential proclamation (United States)\") and [executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order \"Executive order\"). When the president is lawfully exercising one of the constitutionally conferred presidential responsibilities, the scope of this power is broad.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-88) Even so, these directives are subject to [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States \"Judicial review in the United States\") by U.S. federal courts, which can find them to be unconstitutional.

This clause, known as the Reception Clause, has been interpreted to imply that the president possesses broad power over matters of foreign policy,[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-89) and to provide support for the president\\'s exclusive authority to grant [recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_recognition \"Diplomatic recognition\") to a foreign government.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-90) The Constitution also empowers the president to appoint United States ambassadors, and to propose and chiefly negotiate agreements between the United States and other countries. Such agreements, upon receiving the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate (by a [two-thirds majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority \"Supermajority\") vote), become binding with the force of federal law.\\n\\nWhile foreign affairs has always been a significant element of presidential responsibilities, advances in technology since the Constitution\\'s adoption have increased presidential power.

The exact degree of authority that the Constitution grants to the president as commander-in-chief has been the subject of much debate throughout history, with Congress at various times granting the president wide authority and at others attempting to restrict that authority.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-91) The framers of the Constitution took care to limit the president\\'s powers regarding the military; [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton \"Alexander Hamilton\") explained this in [Federalist No. 69](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_No._69 \"Federalist No. 69\"):\\n\\n> The President is to be commander-in-chief of the army and navy of the United States.... It would amount to nothing more than the supreme command and direction of the military and naval forces... while that [the power] of the [British king](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Great_Britain \"Monarchy of Great Britain\") extends to the DECLARING of war and to the RAISING and REGULATING of fleets and armies, all [of] which... would appertain to the legislature.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-92) [Emphasis in the original.]\\n\\nIn the modern era, pursuant to the [War Powers Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Powers_Resolution \"War Powers Resolution\"), Congress must authorize any troop deployments longer than 60 days, although that process relies on triggering mechanisms that have never been employed, rendering it ineffectual.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-miller-center-93) Additionally, Congress provides a check to presidential military power through its control over military spending and regulation. Presidents have historically initiated the process for going to war,[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws12novef-94)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov102-95) but critics have charged that there have been several conflicts in which presidents did not get official declarations, including [Theodore Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Roosevelt \"Theodore Roosevelt\")\\'s military move into [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama \"Panama\") in 1903,[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws12novef-94) the [Korean War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War \"Korean War\"),[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws12novef-94) the [Vietnam War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War \"Vietnam War\"),[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws12novef-94) and the invasions of [Grenada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grenada \"Grenada\") in 1983[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov101-96) and [Panama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama \"Panama\") in 1989.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov100-97)\\n\\nThe amount of military detail handled personally by the president in wartime has varied greatly.[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-98) George Washington, the first U.S. president, firmly established [military subordination under civilian authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_control_of_the_military \"Civilian control of the military\"). In 1794, Washington used his constitutional powers to assemble 12,000 militia to quell the [Whiskey Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiskey_Rebellion \"Whiskey Rebellion\"), a conflict in [Western Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Pennsylvania \"Western Pennsylvania\") involving armed farmers and distillers who refused to pay an excise tax on spirits. According to historian [Joseph Ellis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Ellis \"Joseph Ellis\"), this was the \"first and only time a sitting American president led troops in the field\", though [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison \"James Madison\") briefly took control of artillery units in [defense of Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_of_Washington \"Burning of Washington\"), during the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 \"War of 1812\").[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-99)[Abraham Lincoln](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln \"Abraham Lincoln\") was deeply involved in overall strategy and in day-to-day operations during the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War \"American Civil War\"), 1861–1865; historians have given Lincoln high praise for his strategic sense and his ability to select and encourage commanders such as [Ulysses S.

However, these nominations require [Senate confirmation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advice_and_consent#United_States \"Advice and consent\") before they may take office. Securing Senate approval can provide a major obstacle for presidents who wish to orient the federal judiciary toward a particular ideological stance. When nominating judges to [U.S. district courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court \"United States district court\"), presidents often respect the long-standing tradition of [senatorial courtesy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senatorial_courtesy \"Senatorial courtesy\"). Presidents may also grant [pardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon \"Pardon\") and [reprieves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardon#Related_concepts \"Pardon\"). [Gerald Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Ford \"Gerald Ford\") pardoned [Richard Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon \"Richard Nixon\") a month after taking office. Presidents often grant pardons shortly before leaving office, like when [Bill Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Clinton \"Bill Clinton\") pardoned [Patty Hearst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Hearst \"Patty Hearst\") on his last day in office; this is often [controversial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controversy \"Controversy\").[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov12-104)[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov11-105)[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws8nov10-106)\\n\\nTwo doctrines concerning executive power have developed that enable the president to exercise executive power with a degree of autonomy. The first is [executive privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_privilege \"Executive privilege\"), which allows the president to withhold from disclosure any communications made directly to the president in the performance of executive duties. George Washington first claimed the privilege when Congress requested to see [Chief Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United States\")[John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay \"John Jay\")\\'s notes from an unpopular treaty negotiation with [Great Britain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Great_Britain \"Kingdom of Great Britain\"). While not enshrined in the Constitution or any other law, Washington\\'s action created the precedent for the privilege. When Nixon tried to use executive privilege as a reason for not turning over subpoenaed evidence to Congress during the [Watergate scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watergate_scandal \"Watergate scandal\"), the Supreme Court ruled in _[United States v. Nixon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\\\_States\\\\_v.\\\\_Nixon \"United States v. Nixon\")_, that executive privilege did not apply in cases where a president was attempting to avoid criminal prosecution. When Bill Clinton attempted to use executive privilege regarding the [Lewinsky scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton%E2%80%93Lewinsky_scandal \"Clinton–Lewinsky scandal\"), the Supreme Court ruled in _[Clinton v. Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinton\\\\_v.\\\\_Jones \"Clinton v. Jones\")_, that the privilege also could not be used in civil suits. These cases established the [legal precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precedent \"Precedent\") that executive privilege is valid, although the exact extent of the privilege has yet to be clearly defined. Additionally, federal courts have allowed this privilege to radiate outward and protect other executive branch employees but have weakened that protection for those executive branch communications that do not involve the president.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-107)\\n\\nThe [state secrets privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_secrets_privilege \"State secrets privilege\") allows the president and the executive branch to withhold information or documents from [discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discovery_(law) \"Discovery (law)\") in legal proceedings if such release would harm [national security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security \"National security\"). Precedent for the privilege arose early in the 19th century when [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson \"Thomas Jefferson\") refused to release military documents in the [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason \"Treason\") trial of [Aaron Burr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Burr \"Aaron Burr\") and again in _[Totten v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totten\\\\_v.\\\\_United\\\\_States \"Totten v. United States\")_, when the Supreme Court dismissed a case brought by a former Union spy.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-108) However, the privilege was not formally recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court until _[United States v. Reynolds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United\\\\_States\\\\_v.\\\\_Reynolds \"United States v. Reynolds\")_, where it was held to be a [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law \"Common law\")[evidentiary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evidence_(law) \"Evidence (law)\") privilege.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-ACS-109) Before the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks \"September 11 attacks\"), use of the privilege had been rare, but increasing in frequency.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-110) Since 2001, the government has asserted the privilege in more cases and at earlier stages of the litigation, thus in some instances causing dismissal of the suits before reaching the merits of the claims, as in the [Ninth Circuit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Ninth_Circuit \"United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit\")\\'s ruling in _[Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed\\\\_v.\\\\_Jeppesen\\\\_Dataplan,\\\\_Inc. \"Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.\")_[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-ACS-109)[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-111)[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-112) Critics of the privilege claim its use has become a tool for the government to cover up illegal or embarrassing government actions.[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-113)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-114)\\n\\nThe degree to which the president personally has [absolute immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_immunity \"Absolute immunity\") from court cases is contested and has been the subject of several Supreme Court decisions. _[Nixon v. Fitzgerald](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon\\\\_v.\\\\_Fitzgerald \"Nixon v. Fitzgerald\")_ (1982) dismissed a civil lawsuit against by-then former president Richard Nixon based on his official actions. _Clinton v. Jones_ (1997) decided that a president has no immunity against civil suits for actions taken before becoming president and ruled that a sexual harassment suit could proceed without delay, even against a sitting president. The 2019 [Mueller report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mueller_report \"Mueller report\") on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election detailed evidence of possible [obstruction of justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obstruction_of_justice \"Obstruction of justice\"), but investigators declined to refer [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump \"Donald Trump\") for prosecution based on a [United States Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice \"United States Department of Justice\") policy against indicting an incumbent president. The report noted that impeachment by Congress was available as a remedy. As of October 2019, a case was pending in the federal courts regarding access to personal tax returns in a criminal case brought against Donald Trump by the [New York County District Attorney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_County_District_Attorney \"New York County District Attorney\") alleging violations of New York state law.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-115)\\n\\nMemoranda from the [Office of Legal Counsel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Legal_Counsel \"Office of Legal Counsel\") issued in 1973 and 2000 internally prohibit the Department of Justice from prosecuting a president, which some legal scholars have criticized but others have endorsed.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-116)\\n\\nIn defense against federal criminal prosecution for his [alleged 2020 election subversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_(election_obstruction_case) \"Federal prosecution of Donald Trump (election obstruction case)\"), in January 2024, Trump argued to the [DC Circuit Court of Appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Circuit_Court_of_Appeals \"DC Circuit Court of Appeals\") that a president enjoys absolute immunity for criminal acts conducted while in office. The next month, a three-judge panel of the court unanimously ruled against Trump. It was the first time an appeals court had addressed such a presidential immunity matter, since no other sitting or former president had ever been criminally indicted.[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-117)\\n\\nIn _[Trump v. United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump\\\\_v.\\\\_United\\\\_States\\\\_(2024) \"Trump v. United States (2024)\")_, on July 1, 2024, the Supreme Court ruled that presidents were entitled to absolute immunity from exercising core powers enumerated by the Constitution, [presumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presumption \"Presumption\") of immunity for other official acts, and no immunity for unofficial actions. The case was sent back to lower courts to determine which actions in the criminal complaint should be classified as official vs. unofficial.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-118) The ruling was the first time the courts granted a president criminal immunity.\\n\\nLeadership roles\\n----------------\\n\\n### Head of state\\n\\n![Image 22](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/60px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png)\\n\\n[Four ruffles and flourishes and \\'Hail to the Chief\\' (long version)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Four_ruffles_and_flourishes,_hail_to_the_chief_(long_version).ogg \"File:Four ruffles and flourishes, hail to the chief (long version).ogg\")\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n_Problems playing this file?

[Rutherford B. Hayes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutherford_B._Hayes \"Rutherford B.

Since 1989, when the custom of \"pardoning\" the turkey was formalized by [George H. W. Bush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_H._W._Bush \"George H. W.

Many outgoing presidents since [James Buchanan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Buchanan \"James Buchanan\") traditionally give advice to their successor during the [presidential transition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_transition \"United States presidential transition\").[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-125)[Ronald Reagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan \"Ronald Reagan\") and his successors have also left a private message on the desk of the Oval Office on [Inauguration Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_inauguration \"United States presidential inauguration\") for the incoming president.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-126)\\n\\nThe modern presidency holds the president as one of the nation\\'s premier celebrities. Some argue that images of the presidency have a tendency to be manipulated by administration [public relations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_relations \"Public relations\") officials as well as by presidents themselves. One critic described the presidency as \"propagandized leadership\" which has a \"mesmerizing power surrounding the office\".[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws11nov304-127) Administration public relations managers staged carefully crafted [photo-ops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_op \"Photo op\") of smiling presidents with smiling crowds for television cameras.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-tws11novjopkl-128) One critic wrote the image of John F.

With the advent of binding primaries in most states, presidential nominees typically enjoy the support of a majority or plurality of their party\\'s voters. Since the entire House of Representatives and at least one-third of the Senate is elected simultaneously with the president, candidates from a political party frequently have their electoral success intertwined with the performance of the party\\'s presidential candidate. The [coattail effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coattail_effect \"Coattail effect\"), or lack thereof, will also often impact a party\\'s candidates at state and local levels of government as well. However, there are often tensions between a president and others in the party, with presidents who lose significant support from their party\\'s caucus in Congress generally viewed to be weaker and less effective. Also, because the United States is not a parliamentary system, presidents\\' parties do not necessarily enjoy majorities in one or more houses of Congress, nor in the governorships or state legislatures of many states.\\n\\n### Global leader\\n\\nWith the rise of the United States as a [superpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower \"Superpower\") in the 20th century, and the United States having the world\\'s largest economy into the 21st century, the president is typically viewed as a global leader, and at times the world\\'s most powerful political figure. The position of the United States as the leading member of [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO \"NATO\"), and the country\\'s strong relationships with other wealthy or democratic nations like those comprising the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union \"European Union\"), have led to the moniker that the president is the \"[leader of the free world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_free_world \"Leader of the free world\")\".\\n\\nSelection process\\n-----------------\\n\\n### Eligibility\\n\\n[Article II, Section 1, Clause 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Two_of_the_United_States_Constitution#Clause_5:_Qualifications_for_office \"Article Two of the United States Constitution\") of the Constitution sets three qualifications for holding the presidency.

However, this disqualification can be lifted by a two-thirds vote of each house of Congress.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-135) There is, again, some debate as to whether the clause as written allows disqualification from the presidential position, or whether it would first require litigation outside of Congress, although there is precedent for use of this amendment outside of the original intended purpose of excluding [Confederates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America \"Confederate States of America\") from public office after the Civil War.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-136)\\n*   Under the [Twenty-second Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), no person can be elected president more than twice.

The cabinet currently has 15 members, of which the secretary of state is first in line; the other Cabinet secretaries follow in the order in which their department (or the department of which their department is the successor) was created.

He also contended with four criminal cases. Trump announced his fourth bid to the presidency in 2022, ultimately becoming the nominee of his party for the third time and won a second presidential term in 2024. [Grover Cleveland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover_Cleveland \"Grover Cleveland\") was also elected to nonconsecutive terms; his reelection bid failed in [1888](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1888_United_States_presidential_election \"1888 United States presidential election\") but succeeded in [1892](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1892_United_States_presidential_election \"1892 United States presidential election\").\\n\\n### Pension and other benefits\\n\\nThe [Former Presidents Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Former_Presidents_Act \"Former Presidents Act\") (FPA), enacted in 1958, grants lifetime benefits to former presidents and their widows, including a monthly pension, medical care in military facilities, health insurance, and Secret Service protection; also provided is funding for a certain number of staff and for office expenses. The act has been amended several times to provide increases in presidential pensions and in the allowances for office staff. The FPA excludes any president who was removed from office by [impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_impeachment_in_the_United_States \"Federal impeachment in the United States\").[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CRS-192)\\n\\nAccording to a 2008 report by the [Congressional Research Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Research_Service \"Congressional Research Service\"):[[186]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-CRS-192)\\n\\n> Chief executives leaving office prior to 1958 often entered retirement pursuing various occupations and received no federal assistance. When industrialist Andrew Carnegie announced a plan in 1912 to offer $25,000 annual pensions to former Presidents, many Members of Congress deemed it inappropriate that such a pension would be provided by a private corporation executive. That same year, legislation was first introduced to create presidential pensions, but it was not enacted. In 1955, such legislation was considered by Congress because of former President Harry S. Truman\\'s financial limitations in hiring an office staff\\n\\nThe pension has increased numerous times with congressional approval. Retired presidents receive a pension based on the salary of the current administration\\'s cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 per year in 2012.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-193) Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect [congressional pensions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_pension \"Congressional pension\").[[188]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-194) The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and [franking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franking \"Franking\") privileges.\\n\\nPrior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president\\'s death.[[189]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-195)[[190]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-196) In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting Secret Service protection to no more than 10 years from the date a president leaves office.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-secretservice.gov-197) On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime Secret Service protection for him, [George W.

They evolved from [political factions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_faction \"Political faction\"), which began to appear almost immediately after the Federal government came into existence. Those who supported the [Washington administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_George_Washington \"Presidency of George Washington\") were referred to as \"pro-administration\" and would eventually form the [Federalist Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party \"Federalist Party\"), while those in opposition largely joined the emerging [Democratic-Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic-Republican_Party \"Democratic-Republican Party\").[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_note-201)\\n\\nGreatly concerned about the very real capacity of political parties to destroy the fragile unity holding the nation together, Washington remained [unaffiliated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_politician \"Independent politician\") with any political faction or party throughout his eight-year presidency.

Instead, it relies on reporting requirements that, if triggered, begin the clock running for Congress to approve the particular armed conflict. By the terms of the 1973 Resolution, however, Congress need not act to disapprove the conflict; the cessation of all hostilities is required in 60 to 90 days merely if Congress fails to act. Many have criticized this aspect of the Resolution as unwise and unconstitutional, and no president in the past 35 years has filed a report \"pursuant\" to these triggering provisions.\\n88.   ^ [_**a**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-tws12novef_94-0)[_**b**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-tws12novef_94-1)[_**c**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-tws12novef_94-2)[_**d**_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-tws12novef_94-3)[\"The Law: The President\\'s War Powers\"](https://web.archive.org/web/20080107101712/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,878290,00.html). _Time_.

Use of the state secrets privilege in courts has grown significantly over the last twenty-five years. In the twenty-three years between the decision in Reynolds [1953] and the election of Jimmy Carter, in 1976, there were four reported cases in which the government invoked the privilege. Between 1977 and 2001, there were a total of fifty-one reported cases in which courts ruled on invocation of the privilege. Because reported cases represent only a fraction of the total cases in which the privilege is invoked or implicated, it is unclear precisely how dramatically the use of the privilege has grown. But the increase in reported cases is indicative of greater willingness to assert the privilege than in the past.\\n105.   **[^](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States#cite_ref-111)**Savage, Charlie (September 8, 2010).

A member of the [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) \"Republican Party (United States)\"), he served as the 45th president from 2017 to 2021.\\n\\nBorn into a wealthy family in New York City, Trump graduated from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Pennsylvania \"University of Pennsylvania\") in 1968 with a [bachelor\\'s degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree \"Bachelor\\'s degree\") in economics. He became the president of his family\\'s real estate business in 1971, renamed it [the Trump Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Trump_Organization \"The Trump Organization\"), and began acquiring and building skyscrapers, hotels, casinos, and golf courses. He launched side ventures, many licensing the Trump name, and filed for six business bankruptcies in the 1990s and 2000s. From 2004 to 2015, he hosted the reality television show _[The Apprentice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\\\_Apprentice\\\\_(American\\\\_TV\\\\_series) \"The Apprentice (American TV series)\")_, bolstering his fame as a billionaire. Presenting himself as a political outsider, Trump won the [2016 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election \"2016 United States presidential election\") against [Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) \"Democratic Party (United States)\") nominee [Hillary Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hillary_Clinton \"Hillary Clinton\").\\n\\nDuring his first presidency, Trump imposed [a travel ban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_13769 \"Executive Order 13769\") on seven Muslim-majority countries, expanded the [Mexico–United States border wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico%E2%80%93United_States_border_wall \"Mexico–United States border wall\"), and enforced [a family separation policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_administration_family_separation_policy \"Trump administration family separation policy\") on the border. He rolled back environmental and business regulations, signed the [Tax Cuts and Jobs Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\"), and appointed three Supreme Court justices. In foreign policy, Trump withdrew the U.S. from agreements on climate, trade, and Iran\\'s nuclear program, and initiated [a trade war with China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war \"China–United States trade war\"). In response to the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_the_United_States \"COVID-19 pandemic in the United States\") from 2020, he downplayed its severity, contradicted health officials, and signed the [CARES Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act \"CARES Act\"). After losing the [2020 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_United_States_presidential_election \"2020 United States presidential election\") to [Joe Biden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Biden \"Joe Biden\"), Trump [attempted to overturn the result](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attempts_to_overturn_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election \"Attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election\"), culminating in the [January 6 Capitol attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_Capitol_attack \"January 6 Capitol attack\") in 2021. He was impeached in 2019 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, and in 2021 for incitement of insurrection; the Senate acquitted him both times.\\n\\nIn 2023, Trump was found liable in civil cases [for sexual abuse and defamation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Jean_Carroll_v._Donald_J._Trump \"E. Jean Carroll v. Donald J. Trump\") and [for business fraud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_business_fraud_lawsuit_against_the_Trump_Organization \"New York business fraud lawsuit against the Trump Organization\"). He was found guilty [of falsifying business records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosecution_of_Donald_Trump_in_New_York \"Prosecution of Donald Trump in New York\") in 2024, making him the first U.S. president convicted of a felony.

High-profile cases have underscored his broad interpretation of the [unitary executive theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unitary_executive_theory \"Unitary executive theory\") and have led to significant conflicts with the federal courts. In 2025, he authorized [airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites \"United States strikes on Iranian nuclear sites\").\\n\\nSince 2015, Trump\\'s leadership style and political agenda—often referred to as [Trumpism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trumpism \"Trumpism\")—have reshaped the Republican Party\\'s identity. Many of his comments and actions have been [characterized as racist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Donald_Trump \"Racial views of Donald Trump\") or misogynistic, and he has [made false or misleading statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_or_misleading_statements_by_Donald_Trump \"False or misleading statements by Donald Trump\") and [promoted conspiracy theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_conspiracy_theories_promoted_by_Donald_Trump \"List of conspiracy theories promoted by Donald Trump\") to an extent unprecedented in American politics. Trump\\'s actions, especially in his second term, have been described as authoritarian and contributing to [democratic backsliding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_backsliding_in_the_United_States \"Democratic backsliding in the United States\"). After his first term, scholars and historians [ranked him](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_rankings_of_presidents_of_the_United_States#Scholar_survey_summary \"Historical rankings of presidents of the United States\") as one of the worst presidents in American history.\\n\\nEarly life and education\\n------------------------\\n\\n[![Image 9: A black-and-white photograph of Trump as a teenager, smiling, wearing a dark pseudo-military uniform with three ribbons and a white shoulder strap](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e9/Donald_Trump_NYMA.jpg/250px-Donald_Trump_NYMA.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Donald_Trump_NYMA.jpg)\\n\\nAt [New York Military Academy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Military_Academy \"New York Military Academy\"), 1964\\n\\nDonald John Trump was born on June 14, 1946, at [Jamaica Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Hospital \"Jamaica Hospital\") in the New York City borough of [Queens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queens \"Queens\"), the fourth child of [Fred Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump \"Fred Trump\") and [Mary Anne MacLeod Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anne_MacLeod_Trump \"Mary Anne MacLeod Trump\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKranishFisher201730,_37-1) He is of German and Scottish descent.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKranishFisher2017v-2) He grew up with his older siblings, [Maryanne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryanne_Trump_Barry \"Maryanne Trump Barry\"), [Fred Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Trump_Jr. \"Fred Trump Jr.\"), and Elizabeth, and his younger brother, [Robert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trump \"Robert Trump\"), in a mansion in the [Jamaica Estates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamaica_Estates \"Jamaica Estates\") neighborhood of Queens.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#cite_note-3) Fred Trump paid his children each about $20,000 a year, equivalent to $265,000 a year in 2024.

Trump is the 45th President of the United States. He believes the United States has incredible potential and will go on to exceed even its remarkable achievements of the past.**\\n\\nDonald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. Mr. Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service. He remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office.\\n\\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, Mr. Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City. There, the Trump name soon became synonymous with the most prestigious of addresses in Manhattan and, subsequently, throughout the world.\\n\\nMr. Trump is also an accomplished author. He has written more than fourteen bestsellers. His first book,_The Art of the Deal_, is considered a business classic.\\n\\nMr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Presidency on June 16, 2015. He then accepted the Republican nomination for President of the United States in July of 2016, having defeated 17 other contenders during the Republican primaries.\\n\\nOn November 8, 2016, Mr. Trump was elected President in the largest Electoral College landslide for a Republican in 28 years. Mr. Trump won more than 2,600 counties nationwide, the most since President Ronald Reagan in 1984. He received the votes of more than 62 million Americans, the most ever for a Republican candidate.\\n\\nPresident Trump has delivered historic results in his first term in office despite partisan gridlock in the Nation’s Capital, and resistance from special interests and the Washington Establishment.\\n\\nHe passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 2 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation’s borders.\\n\\nTo vanquish the COVID-19 global pandemic, President Trump launched the greatest national mobilization since World War II. The Trump Administration enacted the largest package of financial relief in American history, created the most advanced testing system in the world, developed effective medical treatments to save millions of lives, and launched Operation Warp Speed to deliver a vaccine in record time and defeat the Virus.\\n\\nPresident Trump and his wife, Melania, are parents to their son, Barron. Mr. Trump also has four adult children, Don Jr., Ivanka, Eric, and Tiffany, as well as 10 grandchildren.\\n\\n[Learn more about First Lady Melania Trump here.](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/people/melania-trump/)\\n\\n[](https://trumpwhitehouse.archives.gov/)The White House\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n*   [](https://twitter.com/whitehouse45)\\n*   [](https://www.facebook.com/WhiteHouse45/)\\n*   [](https://www.instagram.com/whitehouse45/)\\n*   [](https://www.youtube.com/whitehouse45)\\n\\n*   [President Donald J.

Trump Official Presidential Portrait](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/President-Donald-Trump-Official-Presidential-Portrait.png)\\n\\nAfter a landslide election victory in 2024, President Donald J. Trump is returning to the White House to build upon his previous successes and use his mandate to reject the extremist policies of the radical left while providing tangible quality of life improvements for the American people.\\n\\nThis includes putting a stop to endless wars, defending our nation’s borders, and unleashing the potential of the American economy, affording ALL Americans the opportunity to pursue THEIR version of the American dream.\\n\\nIn his first administration, President Trump passed record-setting tax cuts and regulation cuts, achieved energy independence, replaced NAFTA with the United-States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, invested $2 trillion to completely rebuild the Military, launched the Space Force, obliterated the ISIS Caliphate, achieved a major breakthrough for peace in the Middle East, passed the most significant Veterans Affairs reforms in half a century, confirmed over 250 federal judges, including 3 Supreme Court Justices, signed bipartisan Criminal Justice Reform, lowered drug prices, protected Medicare and Social Security, and secured our nation’s borders in his first four years in office. This was only the beginning.\\n\\nDonald J. Trump defines the American success story. Throughout his life he has continually set the standards of business and entrepreneurial excellence, especially in real estate, sports, and entertainment. President Trump built on his success in private life when he entered into politics and public service.\\n\\nHe remarkably won the Presidency in his first ever run for any political office. He won a second time despite several assassination attempts and the unprecedented weaponization of law fare against him. Time after time President Trump has defied the odds because he fundamentally believes in the exceptionalism of the American spirit and wants to see our great country succeed.\\n\\nA graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, President Trump followed in his father’s footsteps into the world of real estate development, making his mark in New York City.
